          The 2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will be
          held in Istanbul, Turkey, from Sunday July 7th through Friday July
          12th, 2013.  Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the cultural,
          economic, and financial center of the country.  The city is a bridge
          between two continents as well as between cultures and traditions. In
          its long history, Istanbul has served as the capital of the Eastern
          Roman and Ottoman empires, whose legacy still survives in the city’s
          architecture and culture.
